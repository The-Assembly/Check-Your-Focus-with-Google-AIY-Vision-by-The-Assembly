# Check-Your-Focus-with-Google-AIY-Vision-by-The-Assembly
The AIY Vision Kit is a handy hardware bundle created by Google, one of several projects aimed at Do-It-Yourself Artificial Intelligence (AIY = Artificial Intelligence Yourself). These kits are available at most computer hardware stores and online retailers in Dubai and contain all the hardware (including a Raspberry Pi with a camera and the Vision Bonnet, a custom board for computer vision) required to build a compact intelligent camera system in a few easy steps, before taking it for a spin on image and face recognition tasks.  In this workshop, we’ll do a deep dive into the AIY Vision Kit and the available libraries for it: learning how to use machine learning models, APIs and the assorted peripherals to create our own desktop focus checker. This smart system will process a variety of visual cues through a neural network to detect when our attention is slipping, a handy feature with the amount of on-camera work we do these days.
